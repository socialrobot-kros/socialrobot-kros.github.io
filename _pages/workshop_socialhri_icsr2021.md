in association with [ICSR 2021 Conference](http://www.colips.org/conferences/icsr2021/wp/)

## Objectives

Service robots need to be devised with social intelligence to be effortlessly integrated into our everyday lives. Service robots are intended to improve the quality of life as well as efficiency in human-robot interactive applications. Especially, human-care service robots are desired to be capable of robust and stable interaction with human users.

Our mission with this workshop is to share the ideas and experiences amongst participants with diverse backgrounds ranging from interaction design, social intelligence, decision making, task planning, and social psychology, and to encourage exploring how social AI for human-robot interaction can be applied to service robots for human-care in our daily lives. This workshop focuses on three social aspects of human-robot interaction of human-care service robots: (1) technical implementation of social AI, (2) form, function and behavior of human-care service robots and (3) human behavior and expectations as a means to understand the social aspects of interacting with these robots and products.

## Topics of Interest

This workshop will focus on the current advances in the area of social human-robot interaction, social AI, social skills, and their applications including clinical evaluations, user studies exploring consumer acceptance of social robots, and so on. Papers are solicited on all areas directly related to these topics, including but not limited to:

- Social perception and context awareness
- Social expression and interactive behavior
- Social task modelling and management
- Social humanoid robot design
- Human-robot interaction design
- Emotion recognition and model design
- Dialogue based interaction
- User evaluation
- Applications for healthcare, receptionist, education

## Submission Guidelines

We invite submission of a 2-page extended abstract in the double-column IEEE Tran format ([template@overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template-example/nsncsyjfmpxy)).

We welcome submissions of previously published works related to the topics of interest of this workshop. We do not officially publish a proceedings, so you can submit and publish your work in other conferences or journals.
