## Objectives

Service robots with social intelligence are desired to be integrated into our everyday lives. Service robots are intended to improve aspects of quality of life as well as efficiency in human-robot interactive applications. Especially, human-care service robots are desired to have more robust and stable interaction capability not only with human but also with daily objects. The interaction with human is more toward the traditional human-robot interaction and the interaction with daily objects is toward the robotic manipulation in human-care settings. We are organizing an exciting workshop at IROS 2020 that is oriented towards sharing the ideas and experiences amongst participants with diverse backgrounds ranging from Human-Robot Interaction design, social intelligence, decision making, task-motion planning, social psychology and aspects, robotics manipulation and social skills. The purpose of this workshop is to explore how social AI for Human-Robot Interaction can be applied to service robots into our daily lives. This workshop focuses on three social aspects of human-robot interaction of human-care service robots: (1) technical implementation of social AI, (2) form, function and behavior of human-care service robots and (3) human behavior and expectations as a means to understand the social aspects of interacting with these robots and products.

The workshop is a single-track, half-day meeting that includes the topics of artificial social intelligence for cognitive and physical interaction of human-care robots. We invite world-recognized speakers to present their work and participate in panel discussions that will present good opportunities for the workshop participants, including students. We will also have a technical session and give opportunities to the workshop participants to share and discuss their work. After the workshop, all the presentations and papers will be available on the workshop webpage.

## Topics of Interest

This workshop will focus on the current advances in the area of social human-robot interaction, social AI, social skills, and their applications including clinical evaluations, user studies exploring consumer acceptance of social robots, and so on. Papers are solicited on all areas directly related to these topics, including but not limited to:

- Social perception and context awareness
- Social expression and interactive behavior
- Social task modelling and management
- Social navigation skills
- Robotic grasping and manipulation skills for human-care services
- Social humanoid robot design
- Human-robot interaction design
- Emotion recognition and model design
- Dialogue based interaction
- User evaluation
- Applications such as healthcare, receptionist, education
