<font size="6">Objectives</font>
</center>

Service robots need to be devised with social intelligence to be effortlessly integrated into our everyday lives. Service robots are intended to improve the quality of life as well as efficiency in human-robot interactive applications. Especially, human-care service robots are desired to be capable of robust and stable interaction with human users.

Our mission with this workshop is to share the ideas and experiences amongst participants with diverse backgrounds ranging from interaction design, social intelligence, decision making, task planning, and social psychology, and to encourage exploring how social AI for human-robot interaction can be applied to service robots for human-care in our daily lives. This workshop focuses on three social aspects of human-robot interaction of human-care service robots: (1) technical implementation of social AI, (2) form, function and behavior of human-care service robots and (3) human behavior and expectations as a means to understand the social aspects of interacting with these robots and products.

<font size="6">Topics of Interest</font>
</center>

This workshop will focus on the current advances in the area of social human-robot interaction, social AI, social skills, and their applications including clinical evaluations, user studies exploring consumer acceptance of social robots, and so on. Papers are solicited on all areas directly related to these topics, including but not limited to:

- Social perception and context awareness
- Social expression and interactive behavior
- Social task modelling and management
- Social humanoid robot design
- Human-robot interaction design
- Emotion recognition and model design
- Dialogue based interaction
- User evaluation
- Applications for healthcare, receptionist, education

                                      <span><i>Socially assistive robots are a unique disruptive innovation that will become a crucial part of everyday society, especially in a post-pandemic world. They will aid people with everyday tasks, improve quality of life, and meet the urgent and immediate needs of an aging population. This talk will present some of my group’s (asblab.mie.utoronto.ca) recent research efforts in developing intelligent and autonomous social robots to provide personalized care, and promote independence (aging-in-place) and overall wellbeing of older adults, including those living with dementia. In particular, we will discuss our Brian, Casper, Tangy, Blueberry, Salt and Pepper, and Luke and Leia socially assistive robots that are being designed to provide cognitive and social interventions, help with activities of daily living, and lead group recreational activities in human-centered environments through social human-robot interactions. These interactive robots can serve as assistants to individuals as well as groups of users, while learning to personalize their interactions to the needs of the users by using unique bi-directional affect and persuasive strategies. Numerous user studies conducted with older adults in care settings will also be discussed to highlight how these robots can effectively be integrated into people’s everyday lives to support person-centered care. </i></span>

I will use these projects to illustrate the complex, rich space of designing social AI for human-robot interaction.</i></span>

</b></span><br/>
<span><i>As part of the solutions to an aging society, research on elderly-care robots has been actively carried out around the world. In order for robots to understand the elderly and provide context-sensitive services, robotic intelligence technologies that can identify various human attributes is essential. Among them, human action recognition(HAR) is a fundamental technology to understand the intentions of human behavior and grasp the daily life patterns of human users. This talk addresses a practical action recognition method for elderly-care robots and introduces a real-world RGB-D dataset for robots to recognize daily activities of the elderly.</i></span>

</b></span><br/>
<span><i>While there has been much research on HRI challenges in the context of the home and public spaces, many interaction issues arising from humans sharing their workplace with robots have not received as much focused attention. This talk highlights questions that arise around human-worker interaction in common workplaces, which should be of particular interest to HRI research, as much of the concern, both economic and societal, is surrounding the relationship between humans and robots at work. I will map challenges specific to the workplace and application areas for HRI at work, as well as highlight research in our lab that tackles some interaction issues that arise in the workplace.
